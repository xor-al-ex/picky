Picky! Because there are always a more suitable sample!

Installation:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/xor-al-ex/picky.git
cd picky/
# Recommend using virtual environment
    python3 -m venv picky-env
    unix: source picky-env/bin/activate
    windows: picky-env\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install capa from repo
cd files/capa
python3 setup.py install
cd ../..
# Install requirements
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# If windows:
    python3 -m pip install python-magic-bin==0.4.14


Usage:
Picky can be used on individual files or folders with samples. It automatically detects if it is a folder, and begins
bulk analysis. Per default uses picky 4 analysis process in bulk-analysis, can be specified with the -m switch.
Single files gives only individual report, bulk creates the MetaReport-file as well.

You should be inside of picky's directory, and have virtual environment activated (if used). The malware file(s) can be
located elsewhere.

Example of runs:
    python3 picky.py /home/user/malware/
    python3 picky.py /home/user/malware/sample.exe
    python3 picky.py -m 8 /home/user/malware/

Example; How to review the bulk analysis:
1. After the analysis is complete, go to the new picky_analysis folder created inside the malware folder.
2. Open "PickyMetaReport.txt" to view the tags created from the different analyses done.
    - The different entries are sorted by "difficulty score", the potential easiest first. Advanced packers at the bottom.
3. Manual review or use text search to find samples with wanted functionality or criteria.
4. When you have found a promising sample, got to the working directory of the sample and open its individual report
5. Review the individual report to assert usefulness / accuracy in reporting
    - If it looks too complex or interesting go back to step 2
6. Do your own manual analysis of the sample to verify the findings (open file in disassembler and verify capa's reporting for instance)
    - If unsuitable, go back to step 2
7. Take notes and save file for use in educational setting (remember archive and set password to avoid losing it to anti-malware systems).
